# Construction-bot
build, build and more build


Its a bot build to construct.
It has a 3d printed chassis and gantry and uses mechanum wheels for multi directional movement.
The fork works using n20 motors and screw, which makes them open or close.
The claws work using servo motors.

The gantry moves up and down to lift or place blocks etc using a pulley system.
It has a mpu 6050 gyroscope, based on which the speed of the pulley motors is regulated to allow it to stay balanced.
