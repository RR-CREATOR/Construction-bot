# ðŸ¤– Construction-bot  
**Build, build, and more build.**

Construction-bot is a fully custom-built robotic system designed for automated construction tasks. With a 3D-printed chassis, a mobile gantry, and omnidirectional movement, it's built to lift, move, and place blocks with precision and stability.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Chassis & Gantry:** Fully 3D printed for lightweight, modular construction  
- **Mobility:**  
  - Mecanum wheels enable omnidirectional movement including forward, backward, strafing, and rotation  
- **Fork Mechanism:**  
  - Controlled by N20 gear motors using a screw-driven mechanism to open and close smoothly  
- **Claw Mechanism:**  
  - Operated by servo motors for accurate gripping and releasing of objects  
- **Gantry Lift System:**  
  - Vertical movement powered by a pulley system  
  - Speed regulated in real-time based on balance feedback  
- **Stabilization:**  
  - An onboard MPU6050 gyroscope adjusts pulley motor speeds to keep the gantry balanced while lifting or lowering

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Blender** â€“ For 3D modeling and mechanical design  
- **3D Printing** â€“ Used to fabricate the chassis, forks, gantry, and mounting components  
- **Arduino** â€“ Controls motors, servos, and sensor integration  

- **MPU6050** â€“ Provides pitch and roll data for balance correction logic
